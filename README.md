This Python class provides a high level interface for Christie TruLife+ TCP/IP API.
Only some of the available API commands are implemented at this time.

Normally Christie projectors are controlled via a web based UI. This class offers a possibility of automation that's unavailable through the web UI.

For full API information refer to "Christie TruLife+ Serial Commands" Technical Reference 020-103316-08 documentation.
